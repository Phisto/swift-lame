## TO-DO
                               
- Implement test target
- Write a short usage guide
                               
## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding LAME as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
.package(url: "https://github.com/Phisto/swift-lame.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "3.100.0"))
]
```

## Usage

I really dont know a source for how to use the LAME framework, but you can check out my [CoreAudioConverter](https://github.com/Phisto/CoreAudioConverter) project to see how i use it.
